"""
Test all Jupyter Notebook code-cells from the docs.

NOTE:
All cod cells of a notebook are concatenated as if they have been writtin as a
singe pyhton-script that is executed in one go!

This is done to avoid issues with cells that are not "standalone"
(e.g. that require previous cells to be executed)
