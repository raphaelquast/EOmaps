🏗️ Layout Editor
-----------------

EOmaps provides a **Layout Editor** that can be used to quickly re-arrange the positions of all axes of a figure.
You can use it to simply drag the axes the mouse to the desired locations and change their size with the scroll-wheel.

**Keyboard shortcuts** are assigned as follows:


.. grid:: 1 1 1 2

    .. grid-item-card::

         - Press ``ALT + L``: enter the **Layout Editor** mode
         - Press ``ALT + L`` again or ``escape`` to exit the **Layout Editor**

         **Pick** and **re-arrange** the axes as you like with the mouse.

         - To pick **multiple axes**, hold down ``shift``!
         - | **Resize** picked axes with the **scroll-wheel**
           | (or by pressing the ``+`` and ``-`` keys)
         - Hold down ``h`` or ``v`` to change horizontal/vertical size
         - Hold down ``control`` to change ratio between colorbar and histogram

         **Snap-To-Grid:**

         - Press keys ``1-9`` to set the grid-spacing for the **"snap-to-grid"** functionality
         - Press ``0`` to deactivate **"snap-to-grid"**

         **Undo, Redo, Save:**

         - Press ``control + z`` to undo the last step
         - Press ``control + y`` to redo the last undone step
         - Press ``P`` to print the current layout to the console

Save and restore layouts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. currentmodule:: eomaps.eomaps

Once a layout (e.g. the desired position of the axes within a figure) has been arranged,
the layout can be saved and re-applied with:

- 🌟 :py:meth:`Maps.get_layout`: get the current layout (or dump the layout as a json-file)
- 🌟 :py:meth:`Maps.apply_layout`: apply a given layout (or load and apply the layout from a json-file)


It is also possible to enter the **Layout Editor** and save the layout automatically on exit with:

- 🌟 ``m.edit_layout(filepath=...)``: enter LayoutEditor and save layout as a json-file on exit


.. note::

    A layout can only be restored if the number (and order) of the axes remains the same!
    In other words:

    - you always need to save a new layout-file after adding additional axes (or colorbars!) to a map
