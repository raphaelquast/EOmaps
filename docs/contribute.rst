-----------------------------

Hey! Nice to see that you're interested in contributing to `EOmaps <https://github.com/raphaelquast/EOmaps>`_!

If you need help to get started or got some questions, open a new `Issue on GitHub <https://github.com/raphaelquast/EOmaps/issues>`_,
start a `Discussion on GitHub <https://github.com/raphaelquast/EOmaps/discussions/categories/contribution>`_ or post a message on `gitter <https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#EOmaps:gitter.im>`_ and I'll see what I can do!

Any contributions are welcome!

- New feature implementations (or ideas for new features)
- Enhancements for existing features
- Bug-fixes, code-style improvements, unittests etc.
- Documentation updates
- Outreach (e.g. blog-posts, tutorials, talks ... )
- ...


ðŸ›žGetting started
------------------

The source code of EOmaps is managed on `GitHub <https://github.com/raphaelquast/EOmaps>`_.

To get started, create a new `fork <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>`_ of the `EOmaps repository <https://github.com/raphaelquast/EOmaps/fork>`_
to get your own copy of the source code.

Then, open a terminal, navigate to the folder you want to work in and clone the forked repository via:

.. code-block:: console

    git clone < link to your fork of the EOmaps repository >

For development, make sure that you first checkout the ``dev`` branch which contains all pending changes for the next release.
Then, create a new feature or bug-fix branch and start coding!

.. code-block:: console

    git checkout dev
    git checkout -b "awesome_new_feature"


Once you're done or in case you want/need some feedback, open a `pull request <https://github.com/raphaelquast/EOmaps/pulls>`_ on GitHub!

âš™ How to set up a development environment
------------------------------------------

To contribute to ``EOmaps``, you need a working ``python`` installation.
I recommend using `miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ to set up ``python`` with the following steps:

- Download the latest `miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ installer and install
- Open `anaconda prompt <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#starting-conda>`_ (or normal terminal on ``linux``)
- | Install `mamba <https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba>`_ with
  | ``conda install -c conda-forge mamba``
- | Create a development environment from the ``eomaps.yml`` file with
  | ``mamba env create -f < path to eomaps.yml >``

Content of ``eomaps.yml``:

.. literalinclude:: ../docs/contribute_env.yml

As editor, I recommend using the awesome, free and open-source `Spyder IDE <https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder>`_.
You can install it directly into your environment via:

.. code-block:: console

    mamba install -c conda-forge spyder


Pre-commit hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure uniform code formatting, EOmaps uses `pre-commit hooks <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ to automatically check (and fix) code-style issues such as:

- Trailing spaces in `.py` files
- Compliance to the used `black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ code formatting standards

To initialize pre-commit hooks in your current environment, navigate to the directory where you cloned the EOmaps repository and run the following command:
(e.g. the parent directory containing the file ``.pre-commit-config.yaml``)


.. code-block:: console

  pre-commit install

This will install the required pre-commit hooks in your current environment so that they are run **automatically prior to each commit**.
(The first time pre-commit is run, the necessary packages will have to be installed which might take a short moment)


.. note::

  This means that all files will be auto-formatted prior to each commit to comply with the used code-formatting standards and
  only commits that comply with all pre-commit hooks can be pushed to GitHub.


- To run the pre-commit hooks manually on selected files, simply **add the files you want to commit** with ``git add < filename >`` and then run ``pre-commit``
- If you want to run the hooks on all files, use ``pre-commit run --all-files``

Note: after running the pre-commit hooks, some files might have new changes that must be staged for commit again!



ðŸ“– Building the docs
---------------------

The documentation of EOmaps is written with `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ using the markup language `ReStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_.


To build the documentation locally, simply navigate to the folder ``eomaps/docs`` and then run

.. code-block::

    make html


The first time the documentation is built, all auto-generated files parsed from the python-code have to be generated which might take a bit of time. Subsequent calls will be much faster since they only update files that contain changes!

- Once finished, you will find a new folder in the EOmaps directory (``eomaps/docs/build/html``) that contains all the source files for the documentation.
- Open ``eomaps/docs/build/html/index.html`` to get to the starting-page!


.. admonition:: Automating the build process

    Manually re-building the documentation can be tedious... fortunately it is possible to **automatically re-build
    the documentation** if a file changed and **live-reload** the local docs in the browser with the awesome `sphinx-autobuild <https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-autobuild>`_ package.


    To install, run ``mamba install -c conda-forge sphinx-autobuild``.

    After installation, navigate to the ``eomaps`` directory and  start the automatic build-process with

    .. code-block::

        sphinx-autobuild docs docs/build/html --ignore ["generated/*"] --open-browser


    This will trigger a first build of the documentation and start a http server that hosts the local
    documentation (and live reloads it as soon as the build process finished)



As editor for the docs I recommend the nice free and open-source editor `retext <https://github.com/retext-project/retext>`_.
It provides syntax-highlighting for ReStructuredText and a useful table-edit mode.
